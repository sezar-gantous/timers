# timers app

My fiance needed a simple app that can have a list of preset timers for different tasks.
She couldn't find an app that worked properly on her windows phone...
So naturally I build this simple web app for her. It uses Firebase for database and html timer function.
Its very similar to my "WakeUp heroku app".
